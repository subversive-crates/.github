## Subversive: Crates

This organization tracks repositories that are Rust crates used by the [Subversive Stack](https://github.com/subversive-stack) - a blockchain stack that will never pump any token/coin.

- Please don't fork these repositories. Rather,
  - fork the repository in the [Subversive Stack](https://github.com/subversive-stack), or
  - fork the upstream repository.
- Please don't open pull requests against any of these repositories.  It is likely no one will ever see them. Rather,
  - open an issue in the repository in the [Subversive Stack](https://github.com/subversive-stack), or
  - open an issue in the upstream repository.

With that said, we know of users who prefer access to upstream crates as separate repositories. 
You can find upstream crates in these repositories:

- Polkadot-SDK crates: [polkadot-sdk-substrate-frame-*](https://github.com/orgs/subversive-upstream/repositories?q=polkadot-sdk-substrate-frame-*&type=public&language=rust&sort=name)
- Open Runtime Module Library crates: [open-runtime-module-library-*](https://github.com/orgs/subversive-upstream/repositories?q=open-runtime-module-library-*&type=public&language=rust&sort=name)

### Related Projects

#### [Subversive Stack](https://github.com/subversive-stack)

The opinionated blockchain stack not pumping any token/coin.

Contains repositories that are a fork of a repository in [Subversive Upstream](https://github.com/subversive-crates).
The content of this organization reflect the opinionated nature of the Subversive Stack.

#### [Subversive Upstream](https://github.com/subversive-upstream)

Tracks repositories that are considered upstream of the Subversive Stack.  
You are not likely to use these repositories directly. 
Unless you want to track code extracted from the upstream project. 
Generally that is a Rust crate from the Polkadon-SDK, or the Open Runtime Module Library.
Substrate and Cumulus have also been extracted from the Polkadot-SDK.

### Resources

Until the [Subversive Stack](https://github.com/subversive-stack) deviates from the upstream, the upstream project resources are best.
Consequently, currently there is no forum dedicated to blockchains building on the [Subversive Stack](https://github.com/subversive-stack).
Your best channel for help specific to the Subversive Stack is StackOverflow. 
However I don't promise I'll check there.

### Contribution guidelines

If you want to get involved please do so via the [Subversive Stack](https://github.com/subversive-stack). Please bear in mind Subversive is a blockchain stack that is not pumping any token/coin.  There are no full time anyone available.
This is an old-school open source effort aimed at putting the blockchain end user front and centre. 
So it has the weaknesses and limitations of that approach to open source. 
It also has the strengths of that approach.  
These strengths and weaknesses have been described elsewhere, so there is no additional value in rehearsing that detail here.
